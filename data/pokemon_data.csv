Wartortle is a bipedal, indigoreptilianPokémonsimilar to aturtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pokémon popular with the elderly. Because it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in thePokémon the SeriesepisodeBeach Blank-Out Blastoisethat Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to befreshwater ponds and lakes.

As shown inPokémon Sleep, Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell.[1]Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep.

InGeneration II, Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were theonly known Pokémoncapable of learning the moveSkull Bashnaturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it viabreeding. Blastoise has two forms: Mega Blastoise andGigantamaxBlastoise. WhenMega Evolved, Blastoise develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with its own water cannon. Small ridges develop over its now-red eyes and extend to its ears — which angle slightly backward — and there is a small point on its chin. The two cannons on its back merge into a single, central water cannon of greater size that extends forward over Mega Blastoise's head and can retract back into its shell. This main cannon has power equivalent to that of a tank gun at minimum and possesses a blast range of over 6 miles (10 kilometers). Mega Blastoise's strengthened legs and back enable it to withstand the recoil from its own blasts, but it can also use its arm cannons to further support itself by using moves such asIce Beamto latch itself to the ground before firing a massive attack, such as during its Burst Attack inPokkén Tournament.[2] As Gigantamax Blastoise, it becomes larger. Its eyes are white with bright blue sclerae. Its blue arms, head, and legs change to light blue, and the underside of its shell becomes dark red. Its shell becomes darker and transforms into a battleship-like formation, with 31 cannons of different sizes: sets of twin cannons emerge from hexagon and rectangle-shaped holes within the shell, and a main cannon protrudes from the center. Several white triangular spots are located on its tail and legs. Three red clouds surround the main cannon. Gigantamax Blastoise can adapt to any situation using various cannon combinations. It is not very good at precision shooting, so instead of aiming its attacks, it prefers to overwhelm its opponent by launching dynamic, powerful torrents from its cannons.

It stands on its other two legs, which are long, segmented, and insectoid in shape. Beedrill has two pairs of rounded, veined wings and another stinger on its yellow-and-black striped abdomen. The abdominal stinger contains Beedrill's most potent poison. Beedrill is highly territorial and, unlike real wasps and bees, Beedrill are not confirmed to live in true ""hives"", as they work together to solve basic problems regarding food, territory, and reproduction without any confirmation if there is a singular breeding pair or ""Queen."" As seen in thePokémon the SeriesepisodeChallenge of the Samurai, Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare ofWeedleandKakuna, responding aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing one Beedrill will cause the whole group to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests intemperate forestsand misty wooded areas. It is known to collect pollen, whichTeddiursacombines with fruits to concocthoney. Inthe twelfth chapter of Pokémon Adventures, Beedrill is shown living in groups or packs and producing honey. Prior toGeneration V,Twineedlewas itssignature move. Beedrill canMega Evolveinto Mega Beedrill. As Mega Beedrill, it gains more defined features. The antennae are shorter and T-shaped. Its eyes become longer and sleeker. It now has three pairs of wings; the uppermost pair is larger with black trim along the top. Its stingers become longer and larger, resembling lances. Additional conical, black-and-yellow stingers with white tips take the place of its legs. Its abdomen becomes larger, grooved, and is attached to its thorax by a black structure. A similar black structure connects its head and thorax. The stinger on its abdomen is now a pale yellow, with black stripes over its entire body. Fast-acting poison is stored in the stingers on its limbs, while the tail stinger produces a slow-acting poison used to finish opponents. The instantaneous poisons are instead used to prevent the foe from fleeing.[1] Beedrill evolves fromKakunaand is the final form ofWeedle.

Fearow is a large, mostly brownavianPokémonwith a vulturine neck and broad, powerful wings. It has a long, pointed, pink beak and a decorative redcoxcombon top of its head. Its narrow eyes have very small pupils and do not appear to have colored irises. It has shaggy feathers at the base of its neck and covering the upper portion of its wings. These feathers are cream-colored, as are the tips of its flight feathers. Its sharp-clawed talons are pink, with three toes pointing forward and one pointing backward. Fearow has been around mostly unchanged for many years, as a Pokémon resembling it has been seen on ancient murals. Its large wings and stamina allow it to fly for an entire day without landing. Its long neck and beak allow it to pluck prey from both land and water, and it has even been known to steal from unwary humans. It will shoot upward, and then dive down to catch prey. It will also catch tiny insects that hide underground and circle the ocean for fish. Fearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainlywastelands and desolate fields. Fearow evolves fromSpearow. (For specifics on this Pokémon's Evolution in the games, refer toGame data→Evolution data.)"

Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry and tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow. Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passingBug-typePokémon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in thedesert, Sandshrewhas been foundin caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body. Sandshrew has aregional form:AlolanSandshrew. In theAlolaregion, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas. Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head, and its ears resemble anigloo's entrances. Adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier, with a shell of hard ice covering its hide. The shell is also made of very hard steel. This steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators likeSneasel, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart; smarter predators such asWeavileexploit its soft underbelly. Alolan Sandshrew can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards. Its claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly.[2]A traditional Alolan custom during festivals is a competition to see who can slide Alolan Sandshrew across the ice the farthest.

These Sandshrew can also be found inBlueberry Academy'sTerarium.
Sandshrew is a bipedalpholidotePokémon(though it runs on all fours inPokémon the Series)[1]. Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry and tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow. Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passingBug-typePokémon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in thedesert, Sandshrewhas been foundin caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body. Sandshrew has aregional form:AlolanSandshrew. In theAlolaregion, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas. Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head, and its ears resemble anigloo's entrances. Adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier, with a shell of hard ice covering its hide. The shell is also made of very hard steel. This steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators likeSneasel, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart; smarter predators such asWeavileexploit its soft underbelly. Alolan Sandshrew can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards. Its claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly.[2]A traditional Alolan custom during festivals is a competition to see who can slide Alolan Sandshrew across the ice the farthest. They can also be found in thePolar BiomeofBlueberry Academy'sTerarium, where Alola's island life is simulated. Sandshrew evolves intoSandslash. AlolanSandshrew evolves into Alolan Sandslash.

Most of its body is yellow with a white underbelly. It has a narrow muzzle, almond-shaped blue eyes, and a thick tail. Its back is mostly covered in sharp, brown quills from its tough, dry hide. It has two large claws on its paws and feet. These claws are its primary weapons and are used for slashing, but can also be used for burrowing. Its claws and spikes can both break off, but they grow back quickly and are shed regularly. Sandslash's broken parts can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields. The claws can become harder and smoother if they live in drier areas. Sandslash can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly.

These quills stand taller than a regular Sandslash's quills and resemble icicles. Unlike its Kantonian variant, Alolan Sandslash is rarely seen curling up into a ball, perhaps made difficult by its thick hide and icy spine. Instead, this Pokémon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow while exposing only its spines. Its body emits cold air, which sharpens its quills. Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it to scale icebergs without slipping. Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash can move swiftly by carving a path in the snow with its claws. It can move faster than any other Pokémon while in the snowy mountains.

However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers.[1]People also climb up the mountains it lives in, to see Sandslash's icy spikes sparkle during the light of dawn.

Diglett has aregional form:AlolanDiglett. InAlola, Diglett has developed three fine gold whiskers on its head from living in soil with high iron content and volcanic environment. These whiskers function as sensors and allow it to monitor its surroundings without coming above ground, though it will still occasionally poke its head out to see outside. The whiskers can also be used for communication, wobbling around to relay mood or emotion. They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness.[2] Needing to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts. In Alola, their tunneling activity has resulted in creating cultivated soil. This cultivated soil is good enough for agriculture. The people in the Alola region are said to be very grateful for the actions of Alolan Diglett. However, they are still very small, tying withKlefkiandMeltanas the shortestSteel-type. They can also be found in theCoastal BiomeofBlueberry Academy'sTerarium, where Alola's island life is simulated. Alolan Diglett and its Evolution are theonly known Pokémonthat can haveTangling Hairas anAbility. Despite Diglett having a strong resemblance toWiglettfrom thePaldearegion, the two Pokémon species are not biologically related, having entirely separate diets and habitats.[3]Their resemblance to each other is said to be a coincidental result of adaptations to their respective environments.[4] Diglett evolves intoDugtrio.

Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokémon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. TheTCGdepictsGolduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokémon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen inPokémon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming inlakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away. As mentioned inPokémon Sleep, Golduck is known to paddle its webbed limbs while sleeping.[1]It is believed Golduck is dreaming about swimming. Prior toGeneration V, Golduck and its pre-evolved form,Psyduck, were theonly known Pokémonthat could haveCloud Nineas anAbility. Golduck evolves fromPsyduck.

As mentioned inPokémon Sleep, Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down.[1]It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it, hence why it is best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps. Golem has aregional form:AlolanGolem.

Jutting out of the top of its body are two large, black rocks with a smaller rock in between, forming the shape of a cannon. On the inner edge of the larger rocks are three golden dots. The cannon prevents them from easily rolling into a ball like its Kantonian variant. Alolan Golem has a grumpy and stubborn personality. Should anyone make Alolan Golem upset, it will roar with a voice similar to thunder, discharging electricity from its body at the same time. Alolan Golem is capable of firing the small rock by using magnetism. The rock will be electrically charged, creating shocks across the whole area of impact.[2]Numbness and fainting can occur with even a glancing blow.

To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living inmountainousregions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned inPokémon Sleep, Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down.[1]It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it, hence why it is best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps. Golem has aregional form:AlolanGolem. In theAlolaregion, Golem has shorter forearms with two claws. The feet have only two claws as well. Its face attracts iron sand, creating the appearance of a mustache, eyebrows, and a large black beard. Jutting out of the top of its body are two large, black rocks with a smaller rock in between, forming the shape of a cannon. On the inner edge of the larger rocks are three golden dots. The cannon prevents them from easily rolling into a ball like its Kantonian variant. Alolan Golem has a grumpy and stubborn personality. Should anyone make Alolan Golem upset, it will roar with a voice similar to thunder, discharging electricity from its body at the same time. Alolan Golem is capable of firing the small rock by using magnetism. The rock will be electrically charged, creating shocks across the whole area of impact.[2]Numbness and fainting can occur with even a glancing blow. If rocks are not available, it will fire nearbyGeodudeinstead. They can also be found in theCanyon BiomeofBlueberry Academy'sTerarium, where Alola's island life is simulated. Alolan Golem and its pre-evolved forms are theonly known Pokémonthat can haveGalvanizeas anAbility. Golem evolves fromGravelerand is the final form ofGeodude. AlolanGolem has a dual-typeRock/Electricregional form. It evolves from Alolan Graveler and is the final form of Alolan Geodude.

It has threePhillips headscrews on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in thePokémon the SeriesepisodeGet Along, Little Pokémonthat it has emotions and a way of reproducing. InThe Poké Spokesman, it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such aspower plants or caveswith a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance,Magnemite has been depicted in carvingsdiscovered at theRuins of Alph. It has also been present inAZ's retelling of theKaloswar, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached,it may simply fleeon rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter.

Magnemite is a seeminglyroboticPokémonthat has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has threePhillips headscrews on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in thePokémon the SeriesepisodeGet Along, Little Pokémonthat it has emotions and a way of reproducing. InThe Poké Spokesman, it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such aspower plants or caveswith a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance,Magnemite has been depicted in carvingsdiscovered at theRuins of Alph. It has also been present inAZ's retelling of theKaloswar, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached,it may simply fleeon rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter.

Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has threePhillips headscrews on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such asPokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6 °F (2 °C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area. Magneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in thePokémon the SeriesepisodeThe Poké Spokesman, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found inrough terrain, often nearpower plants. When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen inthe eleventh chapter of Pokémon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in thePokémon Horizons: The SeriesepisodeThe Future I Choose, it can cause interference with phone and internet signals.

Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of Shellder’s body, extends from its often closed mouth. Shellder uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of aSlowpokeand can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve intoSlowbrotogether. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of aKing's Rock, the two will instead evolve intoSlowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. InGalar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads ofGalarianSlowpoke wearingGalarica CuffsorGalarica Wreaths, causing the Evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Shellder that are part of Slowbro change in shape further if it Mega Evolves. Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell changes to a light gray color with irregular darker spots. Its shape changes into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers, which is slightly rounded for Galarian Slowbro. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder has a large horn on either side of its shell, which is purple for Galarian Slowking. It also gains a gem: a red one on the underside for Johtonian Slowking, and a green one between its eyes for the Galarian form. As part of Mega Slowbro, it becomes large enough to contain most of the Slowpoke's body, gaining two holes near the rim and an opening at the tip, through which protrude the Slowpoke's forelegs and tail respectively. While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen inSlowking's Crowning!andAn Evolution in Taste!, the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its host. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed. Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around itsseafloor homeby rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward.

Voltorb is a sphericalPokémonthat resembles a buttonlessPoké Ballwith eyes. The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally. Voltorb is generally found inpower plantsand other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as aPoké Ball, Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result. Voltorb has aregional form:HisuianVoltorb. Hisuian Voltorb, like its modern counterpart, resemble theApricorn-madePoké Ballsof the time period — both appear to be made of a grainy, woodlike substance, with a glossy surface and a hole on top.

As mentioned inPokémon Sleep, Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace.[1]On occasion, it is seen affectionately holding onto the bone while sleeping. Marowak and its pre-evolved form,Cubone, are theonly known Pokémoncapable of learning the movesBone ClubandBonemerang. Marowak and Cubone are also the only known Pokémon capable of using theThick Clubitem. In GenerationsIIandIII,Bone Rushwas another one of their signature moves. Marowak has aregional form:AlolanMarowak. In theAlolaregion, Marowak was faced with an abundance of its natural enemies,Grass-typePokémon. This harsh environment led it to bond closely with its friends, which is said to have created a sort of sixth sense and caused it to take a new form. Alolan Marowak's body is black and it has pale gray eyes. There is a dark, flamelike mark on its skull between the eyes. Compared to regular Marowak's squatter, thicker body, Alolan Marowak is relatively thin. White markings resembling shoulder blades, vertebrae, and hip bones are visible on its back. The bone Alolan Marowak uses is longer than the one regular Marowak uses. It customarily mourns its companions by burying them and dancing in mourning. Alolan Marowak rubs the bone it wields against its forehead to light the ends in a green flame and then twirls the flaming bone. The flame is made from spirit of its deceased mother. The deceased mother has transformed into vengeful spirit that will protect Alolan Marowak. It specializes in an attack where it releases a weak ball of flame from its bone that will relentlessly pursue its foe. Alolans would fear it for a conjurer, due to its rarity and the fearful sight of it dancing with its bone.[2]The dance is also used as a way of mourning for its lost allies. Once its flames have spread onto an opponent, they are impossible to put out with water. The cursed flames are known to cause both mental and physical pain. A special Alolan Marowak inAlolaacts as theTotem PokémonforKiawe'strialinWela Volcano Park. This Marowak possessesZ-Power, an energy that originates fromUltra Wormholesand takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Marowak and completing the trial is aFirium Z. Alolan Marowak is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moveShadow Bone. Marowak evolves fromCubone. InAlola, Marowak has aregional formthat evolves from Cubone.

Starmie is anechinodermPokémonthat resembles two violetstarfishwith faceted skin and five appendages each. The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, an exterior organ which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen inPokémon Snap. From its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe.

Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species. Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds onplains and grasslands. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.

All three forms of Paldean Tauros are covered in dark gray fur, and have a thick black mane, gray horns, black hooves, and dark gray tails with black tips. Each form also has three gray bumps running vertically on its forehead, increasing in size from top to bottom. The physical differences between the three forms are visible on the shapes of their horns, manes, and tails. The three forms of Paldean Tauros are known as ""The Wild Bulls of Paldea"". The Combat Breed of Paldean Tauros has short, rounded, almost straight horns, and its mane and tails are shaped similarly to Kantonian Tauros. Combat Breed Paldean Tauros is known for its thick, powerful muscles and aggressive nature. Thanks to its muscular body, it is skilled at close-quarters combat, able to use its horns to strike at an opponent's weak spots. The Blaze Breed of Paldean Tauros has sharp horns, pointing forward and bent at right angles. Its mane is spiky with streaks of red, and its tails are intertwined. Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros earns its name from the hot air it breathes from its nostrils. When channeling its fire energy, the bumps and horns on Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow red. The horns can reach a temperature of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius), causing anyone gored by them to suffer both wounds and burns. The Aqua Breed of Paldean Tauros has horns that usually point upward but can rotate backward — each horn has two round, bulbous forms and a hole on its tip. Its mane flows downward and is shaped like a beard, with five teardrop-shaped blue accents on it. Its tails are usually straight, but can bend to form a propeller shape, which aids it in swimming. Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros is recognized for its high body fat, which allows it to float easily in the water. It swims by unleashing high-pressure jets of water from its horns, as well as using its tails to propel itself. It can use the same water jets to pierce right through any enemy it hits.

Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found incities and towns. It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats byevolving. Eevee can potentially evolve intoeight different Evolutions. Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution.

Eevee has two forms: thepartnerEevee andGigantamaxEevee. The partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements were likely taken fromPokémon the Series, which implemented similar traits starting inPokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire. The partner Eevee has higher base stats and access tomovesthat normal Eevee do not. The white tip on afemale partner Eevee's tail has larger, rounder scallops than other Eevee. BeforePokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn't found on other female Eevee. Since Sword and Shield, however, the unique tail pattern is present on all female Eevee as a truegender difference. As a result,Pokémon GOwas updated to apply this change to all female Eevee as well.

Due to the fur becoming fluffier and more luxurious, any enemies caught in it will become enamored and lose the will to fight.

InPokémon Yellow,Professor Oakhad originally intended to give Eevee to the player as their first Pokémon, but it is taken byBlueinstead.
Eevee is a small,mammalian, quadrupedalPokémonwith primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found incities and towns. It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats byevolving. Eevee can potentially evolve intoeight different Evolutions. Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution. As mentioned inPokémon Sleep, Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into.[1] Eevee is theonly known Pokémoncapable of using theZ-MoveExtreme Evoboost. Eevee has two forms: thepartnerEevee andGigantamaxEevee. The partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements were likely taken fromPokémon the Series, which implemented similar traits starting inPokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire. The partner Eevee has higher base stats and access tomovesthat normal Eevee do not. The white tip on afemale partner Eevee's tail has larger, rounder scallops than other Eevee. BeforePokémon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn't found on other female Eevee. Since Sword and Shield, however, the unique tail pattern is present on all female Eevee as a truegender difference. As a result,Pokémon GOwas updated to apply this change to all female Eevee as well. The partner Eevee is theonly known Pokémoncapable of using the movesBouncy Bubble,Buzzy Buzz,Sizzly Slide,Glitzy Glow,Baddy Bad,Sappy Seed,Freezy Frost, andSparkly Swirl, as well as the partner powerVeevee Volley. AsGigantamaxEevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds circling it. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and more luxurious, any enemies caught in it will become enamored and lose the will to fight.

Mewtwo canMega Evolveinto either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. Additionally, Shadow Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Mega Shadow Mewtwo X by usingSynergy Burst. MegaMewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from brow-like ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple ridges over its shoulders fusing behind its back as a single, hump-like growth. Its forearms and legs grow much bulkier and gain two protruding ridges resembling veins. Its hands and feet grow bigger, with longer, more prehensile digits. Its tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. Due to the Mega Evolution, Mega Mewtwo X's physical power received a formidable growth. Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs.

Additionally, the Y-shaped line running across its body (now including its legs) glows the same yellowish-orange color. Like its counterpart, Mega Shadow Mewtwo X can stretch its arms and legs. This unique form is achieved when Shadow Mewtwo uses bothShadow Synergy Burstand collected Gaia Power build up. The transformation can be undone if Shadow Synergy Stone is separated from Mewtwo. Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail, underbelly, and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail and also slightly resemblesJessie'shairstyle. On its head, it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to the base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others.
